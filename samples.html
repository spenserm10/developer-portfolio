  <h2>ROBLOX Places:</h2>
  <div style="float: left; margin-left: 5%; width: 40%;" align="center">
    <h3>Ethics Committee Utility</h3>
    <img src="Assets/ECU.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/>
    <p><b>Description:</b> I made this so that people are able to search up user's groups who are not in-game using the groups API. It checks certain departments in a group based on what boxes are checked. It will give a list with the ability to be copied of everyone who is in a hostile group or below a certain rank.

    <h3>Elevator Worksite</h3>
    <img src="Assets/Elevator.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/>
    <p><b>Description:</b> I figured every building needs an elevator, and so why not make one for the fun of it? So that's exactly what I did. I made this elevator completely from scratch, I built and scripted it entirely although I used a couple of royalty free sound effects. It functions extremely well but is still in the works, hopefully with many more neat features to come. But the one particular elevator here features 15 floors with the ability to lock certain floors and a door open & door close button.

    <h3>Guess The Song</h3>
    <img src="Assets/GTS.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/>
    <p><b>Description:</b> I got bored one day and decided to challenge myself to make a game, and so I thought of making a Guess The Song game. My version of the popular game contains several neat features such as: A non-repeating queue of songs (until they are all played at least once), a Win counter with working datastore-service, and of course the method of easily adding in new songs as well as multiple keywords for each song. That way there is no exact guess to get you the win.

    <h3>Message Cipher Center</h3>
    <img src="Assets/Cipher.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/>
    <p><b>Description:</b> This game is kind of amazing, it allows you to encode or decode messages with the different ciphers within it. So far there are only two; Backwards Code, and Shifted Code. It's a very complex string manipulation script, but works well.
