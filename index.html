  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a pretty energetic person who loves to help others and will always attempt to put others before myself. I am a <b>programmer</b> with about eight or nine years of practice, although I have not worked on any big projects as of right now.</p>
  <p>I'll also mention, I'm an Xbox Ambassador and I love to help people!! For those of you who don't know what that is, or what they do. Well they basically watch over the Microsoft Support Forms and ensure everybody is receiving help if they need it. We also respond to tweets sent to the support team and overall make sure the Xbox Community is a great place.</p>

  <p>This definitely depends on my work schedule and how busy I am with college classes and such, but below is when I am typically free:</p>

  <h2>Payment</h2>
  <p>I'm still starting out with contract work but I guess I would start near <b>&dollar;5 USD</b> for most projects, though I will charge cheaper if it's a relatively easy one. I am open for negotiations as well.</p>
  <p>I accept payment in the following forms:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Paypal</li>
      <li>ROBLOX Group Payouts</li>
  </ul>
  <style>
.left, .right {
  float: left;
  width: 20%; /* The width is 20%, by default */
}

.main {
  float: left;
  width: 60%; /* The width is 60%, by default */
}

/* Use a media query to add a breakpoint at 800px: */
@media screen and (max-width: 800px) {
  .left, .main, .right {
    width: 100%; /* The width is 100%, when the viewport is 800px or smaller */
  }
}
</style>
